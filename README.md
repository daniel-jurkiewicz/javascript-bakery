# JavaScript Bakery

A very simple game written in Vanilla JavaScript and inspired by the famous Cookie Clicker idle game.

Your goal is to manage a virtual bakery by forming cookie dough, putting it in the over and taking cookies out before they get burnt. Cookies are then sold, allowing you to purchase more flour in order to continue your cookie-making efforts... ad infinitum.

# Game Rules

1. Form cookie dough balls at the cost of 10 kg of flour each. You can pause the forming at any time.
2. Click the cookie dough balls appearing in the tray below to form cookies, up to 10 cookies per dough chunk.
3. Put the formed cookies in our oven and bake them until golden brown ... or, well, in our case mostly brown. Our cookies change colour indicating their "doneness" at set intervals. They're not quite ready yet at yellow and orange, and burnt at black, but perfect and good to sell at brown - click them then!
4. Ready cookies will be sold at random intervals, increasing our income and allowing us to keep purchasing more flour in order for our bakery to operate effectively.

Happy baking!
