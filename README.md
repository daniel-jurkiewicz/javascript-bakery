# JavaScript Bakery

A very simple game written in Vanilla JavaScript and inspired by the famous Cookie Clicker idle game.

Your goal is to manage a virtual bakery by forming cookie dough, putting it in the over and taking cookies out before they get burnt. Cookies are then sold, allowing you to purchase more flour in order to continue your cookie-making efforts... ad infinitum.
